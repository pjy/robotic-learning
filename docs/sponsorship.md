# Sponsorship Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of sponsorship in this project is to **support open education and open-source learning**.

This project exists to help learners (including students and beginners) explore robotics, electronics, software development, and signal processing in a safe, ethical, and non-commercial environment.

Sponsorship helps reduce barriers to learning by providing resources — **not by purchasing labor or outcomes**.

---

## What Sponsorship Is

Sponsorship means:

- Voluntary financial or material support
- Given to support **learning, experimentation, and documentation**
- With **no expectation of services, deliverables, or results**

Sponsors support the **project ecosystem**, not individual work products.

---

## What Sponsorship Is Not

Sponsorship is **not**:

- Employment
- An internship
- Contract work
- Paid task completion
- A performance-based reward
- A requirement to contribute code

Sponsorship does **not** create an employer–employee, contractor, or internship relationship.

---

## Relationship to Contributors and Students

- All contributors participate **voluntarily**
- Contributors choose what and how they work on
- Learning outcomes vary and are not guaranteed
- Contributors may stop participating at any time

No contributor is required to:
- Meet deadlines
- Log hours
- Complete assigned tasks
- Produce specific results

---

## Use of Sponsored Funds and Materials

Sponsored funds or materials may be used for:

- Educational equipment (e.g., microcontrollers, sensors, tools)
- Electronic components and parts
- Learning materials and documentation
- Hosting or infrastructure for open-source collaboration
- General project support

Sponsored resources are **not** used to compensate individuals for labor.

---

## Sponsors’ Role and Limitations

Sponsors:

- Do **not** direct development
- Do **not** control contributors
- Do **not** receive exclusive access or ownership
- Do **not** influence technical or educational decisions

All project decisions remain independent and community-driven.

---

## Open-Source Commitment

All project outputs are:

- Openly documented
- Publicly accessible
- Licensed under an open-source license
- Available equally to everyone

No sponsor receives special rights to project code or materials.

## Students and Minors

This project may involve students, including minors.

- Participation is educational and voluntary
- Learning activities resemble a maker club or study group
- No labor is exchanged for money or benefits
- Parents or guardians are encouraged to review this policy

Safety, transparency, and education are the top priorities.

---

## Transparency

Sponsorship relationships may be acknowledged publicly in project documentation unless a sponsor requests anonymity.

The project aims to remain transparent about its values, funding principles, and educational mission.

---

## Questions or Concerns

If you have questions about sponsorship, participation, or boundaries, please open an issue or contact the project maintainer.

We believe that **clear expectations create a safe learning environment for everyone**.

## Summary

- Sponsorship supports **learning**, not labor
