# Learning Path Overview

This project is organized to move from simple to more advanced topics.

## Phase 1: Embedded Basics
Goal: Become comfortable with hardware, IDEs, and flashing code.

- USB connection
- Board selection
- Basic I/O

## Phase 2: Sensor Data
Goal: Understand how real-world signals are captured.

- I2C basics
- Sensor noise
- Sampling rate

## Phase 3: Software Integration
Goal: Bridge embedded systems and Linux software.

- Serial communication
- Python data handling
- Visualization

## Phase 4: Signal Processing
Goal: Learn how raw signals become meaningful data.

- Time-domain vs frequency-domain
- FFT
- Harmonics and filtering

This is not a production system. It is a learning journey.
