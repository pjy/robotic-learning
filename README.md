# Open Heart Signal Learning Project

This repository is an **open-source learning project** focused on understanding
embedded systems, data acquisition, and basic signal processing using
Arduino, ESP32, and Python on Linux.

The project is designed for **step-by-step learning** and does not assume prior experience.

## Learning Path

### Step 1: Basic Hardware Control
- Connect an Arduino or ESP32 to a Linux computer
- Install and run Arduino IDE on Linux
- Control the onboard LED (blink, timing, and logic)

### Step 2: Sensor Interface
- Connect a MAX301 heart-rate sensor
- Read raw sensor values
- Understand basic I2C communication

### Step 3: Data Collection
- Stream raw heartbeat waveform data over serial
- Read serial data on Ubuntu using Python
- Store and visualize the waveform

### Step 4: Signal Processing
- Analyze raw heartbeat data
- Extract fundamental frequency
- Compute 2nd and 3rd harmonics
- Visualize frequency-domain results

## Project Philosophy
- Learning-first and experimentation-oriented
- Contributions are voluntary
- Code is for education and exploration
- Mistakes are part of the process
